 Some common DHCP server parameters:

default-lease-time = Integer which sets the default lease time in seconds.
max-lease-time = Integer which sets the maximum lease time, in seconds
ping = check boolean If true, the server pings an address before assigning a lease on that address to a client.
option domain-name–servers = The IP address or addresses of DNS servers the clients may use.
option domain-name = The name of the domain that will grant fr the clients to use.
authorative = The server is authoritative, this DHCP server should send DHCPNAK messages to misconfigured clients
log-facility local7 = Send logs to syslog facility local7
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 { anything enclosed here } the subnet declaration for 192.168.1.10 network
range 192.168.1.50 192.168.1.115 = defines the IP address range that the server will lease IPs.
option routers = defines the IP address of your gateway or the network exit point.
option netbios-name-servers = The IP addresses of NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) servers or Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) servers which are used by SMB/CIFS protocols to share files on Windows.
option netbios-node-type = A code for how NetBIOS clients should attempt name resolution. Values are 1 to use broadcasts, 2 to use a WINS server, 4 to try broadcasts first followed by a WINS server and 8 to try a WINS server first followed by a broadcast.
